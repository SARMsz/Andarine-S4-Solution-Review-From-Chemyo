<h2>What Is Andarine S4?</h2>
<p>Andarine (also called S4) is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM). It binds to androgen receptors in muscle and bone, boosting protein synthesis and nitrogen retention without the estrogen conversion of traditional steroids.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>I’ve used Andarine from Swisschems in past cutting phases. When Chemyo launched their S4, I ran an 8‑week cycle at 25 mg twice daily. I tracked my weight, body fat, and strength on major lifts weekly. I also collected feedback from three friends who ran the same cycle. Based on lean mass gains, strength improvements, side‑effect profile, and price, I rank Chemyo Andarine S4 in my top three SARMs for cutting.</p>

<h2>My Cycle Protocol</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dosage:</strong> 25 mg morning, 25 mg evening (total 50 mg/day).</li>
  <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 weeks.</li>
  <li><strong>Form:</strong> Liquid solution for precise dosing.</li>
  <li><strong>Post‑Cycle Therapy (PCT):</strong> Standard 4‑week Nolvadex protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results I Experienced</h2>
<p><strong>Week 1–2:</strong> I felt mild increase in vascularity and focus during workouts. No visible side effects yet.</p>
<p><strong>Week 3–5:</strong> Strength on squat and bench rose by 10–15 lbs. Body weight stayed stable, but mirror check showed crisper muscle definition.</p>
<p><strong>Week 6–8:</strong> I leaned out by 3 lbs of fat while maintaining my lean mass. My friends saw similar results—one lost 4 lbs fat, another added 5 lbs to deadlift.</p>
<p>Minor vision tint (yellow hue) appeared in low light around week 4, but it faded within 48 hours after stopping the cycle. No other side effects.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>How long should I run Andarine S4?</h3>
<p>Most users run 6–8 weeks. I found 8 weeks gives full benefits without excess side effects.</p>

<h3>What dose works best?</h3>
<p>50 mg per day split into two doses (25 mg AM, 25 mg PM) balances efficacy and tolerability.</p>

<h3>Do I need post‑cycle therapy (PCT)?</h3>
<p>Yes. A standard Nolvadex protocol (20 mg/day for 4 weeks) restores natural testosterone.</p>

<h3>Are there vision side effects?</h3>
<p>Some users see a mild yellow tint or reduced night vision. It usually clears within days after cycle end.</p>

<h3>Can women use Andarine?</h3>
<p>Women can run lower doses (5–10 mg/day) for 6 weeks, focusing on lean tone, but should monitor for virilization.</p>
